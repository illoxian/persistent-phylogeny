  @brief Realize the character \e c (+ or -) in \e g

  Let GRB be a red-black graph, and let c be a character of GRB.
  Let D(c) be the set of species in the connected component of GRB that
  contains c.
  The result of the realization of c+ on GRB, which is defined only if c is
  inactive, is a red-black graph obtained from GRB by adding a red edge between
  c and each species in D(c) \ N(c), deleting all black edges incident on c,
  and finally deleting all isolated vertices.
  The realization of c− on GRB is defined only if c is active and there is no
  species in D(c) \ N(c): in this case the results of the realization is
  obtained from GRB by deleting all edges incident on c, and then deleting all
  isolated vertices.
